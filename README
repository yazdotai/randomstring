Erlang library that simply generates a random string.

It has one function get.

Two parameters:
-  the length of the string
-  the list of string characters from which to randomly choose

This library has been packaged with rebar.

So you can use randomstring from any instance of the Erlang console by installing in the erlang library directory.

This is usually found in :
/usr/local/lib/erlang/li

Once in the folder, install randomstring via git

> sudo git clone git@github.com:benahlan/randomstring.git

And voila!  You can use randomstring from Erlang console in the following way:

>  randomstring:get(5, "1234567890qwertyuiop").
>  8j5dp
